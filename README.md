For the DOM Manipulation Project, I have created a working Calculator from scratch without using any AI for code-generation or for debugging any problem I faced. The most difficult part of the project was to figure out the correct logic with which not only the correct calculations can be performed, but the final result as well as all the operations performed should be correctly displayed. I was confused between two different logics and spent quite some time on making them work until it clicked to me that the correct-working logic was a hybrid of the two.

Thank You!!
